Hi, my name is Yannik and currently still pursuing my master's in IT Security at the University
of Applied Sciences in Munich, Germany.

At the moment I am working on my thesis which is about OpenTitan and FIDO2 implementations.

You can also checkout my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/L0g4n) profile to see what I am working on.
